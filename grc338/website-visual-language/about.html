                    Novo is rich with stories, just waiting to be shared. From the farmers who grow the food, to the chefs who frequent the farmers’ markets to purchase the ingredients, every dish, and every experience, carries meaning. 

                    At Novo, the ingredients that go into making a great dish don't end with farmers' market-fresh produce, incomparable spice combinations or even the freshest meats and poultry. We go beyond those basics and add pinch of passion from our culinary team and a splash of charm from our service team to make each dish an indulgent experience.
                    
                    The Central Coast region, with its mild, Mediterranean climate, has a year-round growing season. Peppers. Lettuces. Beans. Squash. A cornucopia of vegetables. Strawberries. Grapes. Oranges. Avocados. Year-round fruits.
                    
                    We are so fortunate to be located in a region with such a rich and vibrant agricultural industry and history, and as purveyors of fine food, we are proud to support our local farmers. To learn more about the agriculture in the San Luis Obispo region, we invite you to visit the SLO Grown website.
